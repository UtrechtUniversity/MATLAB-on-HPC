Most PCs have a graphical user interface: you interact with your computer by clicking on files, applications, etc. Lisa is a Unix/Linux system, and you interact primarily wit Lisa through a command line interface. Try a couple of basic commands:

    who shows you the list of users that are currently logged in on the same node.
    date shows you the current date and time.
    top shows you the list of processes currently running on the node, including how much resource (cpu, memory, etc) they use. Press q to return to the command line again.
    ls shows the current files in your home directory (if you just logged in for the first time, it may well be empty).
    mkdir [mydir] create a directory with name 'mydir'.
    cd [mydir] change directory to directory 'mydir'.
    logout logs you out of the Lisa system.

If the system is running a command that you want to interrupt, you can always use ctrl+c (try it with the top command).
