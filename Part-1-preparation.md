# Part 1: Create a Docker container and install Matlab

When you are working on Windows or Mac, we recommend installing a Docker container with a Linux operating system and MATLAB on your computer to compile MATLAB code, as code has to be compiled on a linux system in order to be compatible with HPC. The steps to install this container with a MATLAB installation for Linux are described here. If you already have the required MATLAB version running under Linux you can go to [Part 2](./Part-2-running-matlab.md). Backgrounds about Docker software and basic commands can be found [here](./Docker_intro.md).

This part of the workflow is all preparation. The steps in this part only need to be executed once.

## Step 0: Obtaining an account

Before walking through this manual you need to obtain an account for HPC. Contact [Research and Data management](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/contact-us) at the UU to discuss options. Or visit the websites of [Surfsara](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/account) or [UBC](https://wiki.bioinformatics.umcutrecht.nl/HPC).

## Step 1: Install Docker software on PC

There are different versions of Docker available for different operating systems. 
The different Docker installations come with slightly different instructions so we created separate manuals for:

Part 1: [Windows 10 Enterprise](./Part-1-Windows10.md)

Part 1: [Windows 10 Home](./Part-1-Windows10Home.md)

Part 1: [Mac](./Part-1-Mac.md)

To check whether you work under Windows 10 **Enterprise** or **Home** version press: Windows key + i
