# SSH

SSH stands for secure shell and is a protocol that makes it possible to remotely login to other computers (such as HPC clusters or virtual machines).
To setup this connection, you need a 'terminal' application. We recommend [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) to do this.

To start a session in MobaXterm: click the Session tab, and fill in the Basic SSH settings: the host that you want to connect to, the username and the port. Potentially some additional settings need to be filled in to smooth the login process at HPC systems: e.g. to jump from a gateway node to a submit node directly upon login, or to attach a key. For these type of settings, follow the login instructions from the HPC system ( [UBC](https://wiki.bioinformatics.umcutrecht.nl/bin/view/HPC/HowToS#How_to_log_in_from_outside_the_U)  or [LISA](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/user-guide/connecting-and-transferring-data) ).

## SSH keys
Some SSH connections are set up using SSH ['key pairs'](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_keys). These can be generated with MobaXterm under tools > MobaKeyGen. When generated by moving your mouse: a public key is displayed in the key generator window. Fill in a passphrase that will be required when making the SSH connection. The public key that is displayed should be copy and pasted in an email to the system administrator. The private key should be saved. To use this private key to make the connection, check the 'Use private key' and navigate to the private key file under Advanced SSH settings when setting up or editing an SSH session.

## SSH to Docker container

Open MobaXterm  
Start an SSH session: Click Session > SSH

Fill in the following fields:   
Remote host: `< IP â€“ address >`  
Username: `user`  
Port: `22`  (or port 23 if you have specified port 23 in the docker run command)
The IP - address that needs to be filled in can be found via windows command line using ```>  docker-machine ls```)  
Under Bookmark settings, choose a session name (e.g. Docker).

Click OK to start the session  
When you are asked for a password, fill in:  
Password: `user`

## Establish SSH connection between Docker container and UBC cluster

Note that (when SSH keys are required for login) each device (i.e. local working station, docker container) needs to exchange keys to make a connection. To make a direct connection from a docker container to the UBC cluster a new set of keys should be generated within the Docker container

In an active session to Docker container, go to the home folder:

```
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
```
Generate key pairs using the following command:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C hpc -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hpc 
```
give a new passphrase (twice).

Open the id_rsa_hpc.pub file
```
vim id_rsa_hpc.pub
```
and copy and paste the contents in an email to the system administrator and exit the file.

## Config file

Now create a config file
```
vim config
```
Paste the following text:

```
# file ~/.ssh/config 
# example HPC config file 
# 20180111 UMC/HPC 

# usage : ssh hpcgw 
Host hpcgw 
  HostName hpcgw.op.umcutrecht.nl
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hpc 
  User <username>

# usage : ssh gw2hpcs03
Host gw2hpcs03
  HostName hpcs03.op.umcutrecht.nl
  User <username>
  ProxyCommand ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hpc -l <username> hpcgw.op.umcutrecht.nl nc %h %p 2>/dev/null

# usage : ssh gw2hpcs04
Host gw2hpcs04
  HostName hpcs04.op.umcutrecht.nl
  User <username>
  ProxyCommand ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hpc -l <username> hpcgw.op.umcutrecht.nl nc %h %p 2>/dev/null
```
Now it is possible to setup an ssh, sftp or scp session between the Docker container and the cluster directly.
Contact UBC system administrators when you need help with this.

## Establish SSH connection between Docker container and Lisa

To establish SSH connection to Lisa, just use the following command in the active docker container:

`ssh <username>@lisa.surfsara.nl`

where <username> is the username of your Lisa account.

Fill in your password when requested.

## Closing SSH session 

Type:
 
`exit` or `logout`
